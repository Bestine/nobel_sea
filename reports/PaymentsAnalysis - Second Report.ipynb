    "In recent times, a detailed regression analysis on appointment trends revealed a significant drop in the rate of MH infusion appointments starting from mid-2023, with the decline becoming more pronounced by early 2024. This observation raised concerns about the potential causes of this trend, particularly whether pricing changes might have contributed to patients discontinuing their services.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this project was to investigate the relationship between payments and patient retention to determine if changes in cost played a role in patient churn. By analyzing patient payment data and appointment records, we aimed to identify patterns that could explain the steep decline in MH infusion rates and provide actionable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project sought to address the following specific questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Did the cost of services directly contribute to patient churn?\n",
    "- What was the rate of patient retention over time, and how did it vary across different patient groups?\n",
    "- Was the increase in service costs the primary driver of patient churn?\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings from this analysis will help uncover the underlying factors influencing patient behavior and provide recommendations for addressing any pricing-related issues that may be affecting retention. Additionally, the insights will guide further exploration into broader economic and operational factors impacting service delivery and patient satisfaction."

    "* While all categories exhibit a similar shape of distribution, all-time patients (those who have been receiving services since before mid-2023 and continued through 2024) recorded the highest total payments for their services.\n",
    "* The majority of `all-time patients` made total payments ranging between $10,000 and $20,000.\n",
    "* Patients in all other categories predominantly paid below 5,000 dollars for their services.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset spans data from as far back as 2018. As a result, it can be inferred that all-time patients and those in the `before mid-2023` category have had longer service periods (up to five years), while patients in the `late mid-2023` and `2024` categories have had much shorter periods of service—approximately six months to one year. This disparity in service duration could explain why `all-time patients` had significantly higher total payments compared to the more recent patient categories. This prompted the need to delve deeper into payment patterns, leading to the idea of analyzing pay per visit(successful appointments)."

    "This analysis offers a detailed look at the changes in payments charged to different categories of patients over time, revealing important trends and insights. After careful examination of the data, the following findings were made:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Patients who visited before mid-2023 tended to pay the least per visit, with their payment amounts generally staying within a lower range.\n",
    "* Patients in the late 2023 and 2024 categories paid significantly higher amounts per visit. This indicates a clear shift in pricing over time.\n",
    "* A gradual increase in prices was observed starting from mid-2023, signaling potential changes in pricing policies or external factors that affected the cost of services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these findings, here are a few key areas I recommend exploring further:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are there any hidden or additional charges that may have been introduced to patients, which might explain the increase in payments?\n",
    "- Could inflation have played a role in driving up the cost of services for patients in the later periods?\n",
    "- Were there any internal factors, such as the provision of services becoming more expensive, that contributed to the rise in payments?\n",
    "\n",
    "I also suggest investigating why 188 patients(`all-time patients`) continued to undergo treatments despite the rising costs. There could be something unique about these patients or their situations that warrants further exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "While I have worked diligently to provide a comprehensive analysis, there were some challenges along the way. One key issue was the inability to obtain specific payment data for MH Infusion, which meant I had to assume it was priced similarly to other services in the analysis. This assumption could affect the accuracy of the findings, especially if the payment structure for MH Infusion differs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving forward, I will continue to refine the analysis, particularly around the MH Infusion data, and will keep you updated on any new insights that emerge. I am confident that this analysis, with a bit more data, will provide even deeper insights into the trends shaping the patient payment experience."
