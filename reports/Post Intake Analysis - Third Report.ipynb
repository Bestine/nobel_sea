    "Previously, we conducted a regression analysis on MH infusion trends, overall appointments, and payment patterns.

    "- How frequent are follow-up services, and are there any delays contributing to the MH infusion decline, especially since mid-2023?\n",
    "- Are patients opting for facilities outside Cambridge after intake?\n",
    "- Are campaigns and conversions effective, as indicated by the number of intakes over time?\n",
    "- How many MH infusions do patients undergo, and how do these figures vary across segments and facility locations?\n",
    "- Are doctors or staff following up with patients to monitor progress or remind them about medication?"

    "**Streamline Cambridge Operations:** Investigate and resolve operational bottlenecks contributing to delays, particularly in MH infusions. Enhance resource allocation and staffing levels to ensure timely service delivery.\n",

    "**Boost Patient Engagement and Retention:** Launch targeted campaigns emphasizing service quality and addressing patient concerns. Consider transportation support, financial incentives, or awareness programs to build trust and loyalty.\n",

    "**Address Shifts to Non-Cambridge Facilities:** Survey patients to understand their reasons for seeking services elsewhere. Optimize appointment scheduling and service delivery to make Cambridge a more attractive option.\n",

    "**Strengthen Follow-Up Processes:** Train staff and introduce morale-boosting incentives to ensure proactive and effective follow-ups. Audit patient data to maintain accurate contact details and establish standardized follow-up protocols.\n",
