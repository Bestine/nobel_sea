    "Recently we did the regression analysis on MH infusion and overall appointment trends, and payment analysis.

    "- How the long did it take the patients to receive their first service after intake?\n",
    "- How the long did it take the patients to receive their first MH infusion after intake?\n",
    "- How many days did it take to get the succeeding service? Are there any delays that are connected with MH infusion drop? (Delays increasing or reducing rapidly since mid of 2023). \n",
    "- Are patients preferring other facilities outside Cambridge after their intake?\n",
    "- Are there enough campaigns and conversions? This will be determine by the number of intakes over time. \n",
