    "In this report, the trends in appointments and MH infusion rates over time are explored.

    "\n",
    "In this analysis, the data wrangling process included the following steps; \n",
    "1. **Dropped irrelevant records:** \n",
    "The records that contained information that was not relevant for the current analysis were dropped. In this case, there was a record with the appointments dates from the year 2000 since they fell outside the scope of this study. \n",
    "2. **Standardized Appointment Categories(Labels):**\n",
    "The appointment status were standardized to make them consistent and meaningful. Specifically:\n",
    "- Appointments marked as \"Made\" were renamed to \"Seen\"\n",
    "- Appointments marked as \"Deleted\" were renamed to \"Cancelled\". \n",
    "3. **Selected Relevant Columns** \n",
    "To prepare the data for time series regression, we identified and retained only the columns necessary for this analysis; \"Date of Service\" and \"Appointment UID\". Any records with missing values from the selected columns were removed to ensure the accuracy of the analysis. \n",
    "4. **Aggregated Data by Date:**\n",
    "Finally, the total number of appointments was calculated by grouping the data by date. This allowed us to create a daily summary of all appointments, which serves as the foundation for analyzing trends over time. \n",

    "Lets smoothen the curves by calculating 7-day, 30-day and 90-day moving averages. Just to make it clear, moving average is a statistical method used to smooth time series data by calculating the average of data points over a fixed time period. For instance, in our case, the 7-day moving average calculates the average of the moost recent 7 days' values and continuously updates as new data points are added.
